# Attemp-at-Galaxy-Zoo-2-challenge
A simple convolutional neural network for multilabel classification I made as an attempt at Kaggle Galaxy Zoo Challenge. To obtain the data used go to https://www.kaggle.com/c/galaxy-zoo-the-galaxy-challenge/data and download the dataset. Save it in a folder called Galaxy Zoo otherwise change the directory names in the files. Run prep data first, this compresses the images, then run Multilabel classification to get the trained network.
